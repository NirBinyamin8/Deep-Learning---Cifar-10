Deep learning project. During the project we worked with the cifar 10 data set and with the help of the pytorch libraries we built a model that classifies and learns the data in the best way and predicts correct predictions for new data.
During the project we examined several hyperparameters:
1. Regularization
2. dropout
3. Learning step
4. Batch normalization
5. Human optimizer
6. SGD optimizer

Each experiment has a cell in the code, and the results are shown in a graph.
To run, the 3 folders must be uploaded to the personal drive, then the drive address must be changed in order for the code to recognize the folders.
Using Google colab (using gpu A100).
